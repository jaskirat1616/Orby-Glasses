### Simplified Version

For users seeking a lightweight alternative, the Simplified Version of OrbyGlasses prioritizes performance and ease of setup by omitting complex features like SLAM and 3D mapping.

**Features:**

*   Real-time object detection using `YOLOv11`.
*   Depth estimation with `Depth Anything V2` for accurate distance measurements.
*   Audio feedback via simple text-to-speech for navigation guidance.
*   Danger alerts for objects within `0.4m`; caution alerts for objects within `1.5m`.
*   No SLAM, 3D mapping, or occupancy grids for reduced computational load.
*   Faster startup and response times.

---

## Requirements

*   **OS:** macOS (for text-to-speech) or Linux/Windows with `pyttsx3`.
*   **Python:** 3.8+.
*   **Camera:** Built-in webcam or IP camera.
*   **Ollama:** For local LLM processing.

---

## Installation

1.  Run the setup script:
    ```bash
    ./setup_simple.sh
    ```
2.  Ensure Ollama is running:
    ```bash
    ollama serve
    ```
3.  Start the application:
    ```bash
    python simple_orbyglasses.py
    ```

---

---

## Key Differences from Full Version

*   Excludes SLAM, 3D mapping, and occupancy grids.
*   Uses `Depth Anything V2` instead of size-based estimation.
*   Simplified audio system (macOS `say` command or `pyttsx3`).
*   Depth estimation runs every Nth frame to reduce computational load.

## Features in Depth (Full Version)

### Visual SLAM and Indoor Navigation

The Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system, paired with the Indoor Navigation module, transforms OrbyGlasses into a proactive navigation assistant.

**Visual SLAM (`src/slam.py`):**

*   Tracks user position in 3D space using a standard webcam.
*   Builds and saves indoor environment maps for persistent navigation.
*   Achieves 10-50 FPS on Apple Silicon, depending on the environment.

**Indoor Navigation (`src/indoor_navigation.py`):**

*   Uses A* pathfinding on a 2D occupancy grid to plan obstacle-free routes.
*   Supports navigation to saved locations (e.g., "kitchen," "desk").
*   Provides turn-by-turn voice guidance.

### 3D Occupancy Grid Mapping

The system constructs a real-time 3D volumetric map to enhance spatial awareness.

**Sparse Voxel Storage (`src/occupancy_grid_3d.py`):**

*   Stores observed voxels efficiently (~1 MB for typical rooms).
*   Uses Bayesian log-odds updates for robust obstacle detection.

**Ray Casting & Sensor Fusion:**

*   Combines depth estimation with SLAM camera poses for accurate 3D mapping.
*   Marks free space along sensor rays and occupied space at endpoints.
*   Handles sensor noise via probabilistic updates.

**Real-Time Visualization:**

*   Displays 2D slices at head height (Blue: free, Red: occupied, Gray: unknown).
*   Updates at 2 Hz with minimal performance impact (<5% FPS reduction).

**Path Planning Integration:**

*   Supports collision-free path planning and spatial memory.
*   Enables map persistence and location revisits.

Refer to `docs/OCCUPANCY_GRID_3D.md` for detailed documentation.

### Trajectory Prediction

Predicts object movements for proactive alerts in dynamic environments.

**Object Tracking (`src/trajectory_prediction.py`):**

*   Tracks objects across frames to build movement histories.
*   Calculates object velocities.

**Social Force Model & GNN (`src/trajectory_prediction.py`):**

*   Uses a simplified GNN and Social Force Model to forecast paths.
*   Issues early warnings for potential collisions.

### Social Navigation

Guides users through crowded spaces with culturally aware instructions.

**Social Norms (`src/social_navigation.py`):**

*   Configurable for regional conventions (e.g., "stay to the right" in the US, "stay to the left" in the UK).
*   Identifies safe passage gaps by analyzing crowd density.

**Contextual Guidance:**

*   Provides instructions like "Gap opening on your right. Safe to proceed."

*   `detection.py`: YOLO-based object detection and depth estimation.
*   `echolocation.py`: Spatial audio generation.
*   `narrative.py`: AI narrative generation via Ollama.

---

## Performance (Full Version)

*   **Without SLAM:** 50ms per frame (20 FPS).
*   **With SLAM:** 70-100ms per frame (10-14 FPS).

SLAM enables advanced navigation but adds overhead. Disable it in `config.yaml` for higher FPS. Trajectory prediction has minimal impact (~0.1ms per frame).

## Ethical Considerations

OrbyGlasses prioritizes user well-being:

*   **Privacy:** Fully local processing; no cloud data transmission.
*   **Safety:** Acts as a navigation aid, not a replacement for tools like white canes.
*   **Reliability:** Graceful failure with audio alerts for issues.
*   **User-Centered Design:** Developed with feedback from visually impaired users.

---

*   Visual SLAM and Indoor Navigation.
*   Trajectory Prediction.
*   Social Navigation.
*   Smart glasses integration (e.g., Vuzix, Xreal).
