# OrbyGlasses - For Blind Users

## What This Really Solves

This system solves the REAL problems blind people face every single day.

---

## Pain Points We Solve

### 1. "Where Can I Walk?"

**The Problem:**
- Not knowing if path ahead is clear
- Worrying about hitting things
- Need to know LEFT, RIGHT, or STRAIGHT

**Our Solution:**
```
"Path clear straight ahead."
"Path clear to your left."
"Multiple obstacles. Safe path to your right."
```

**Why It Matters:**
You can walk confidently knowing where it's safe to go.

---

### 2. "What's About to Hit Me?"

**The Problem:**
- Objects appear suddenly
- No time to react
- Head-height hazards (poles, signs, branches)

**Our Solution:**
```
"STOP! Pole on your left, 0.8 meters. Do not move forward."
"Warning: Branch at head height directly ahead."
"Person approaching on your right, 1.5 meters."
```

**Why It Matters:**
You get WARNING before danger, not after you hit it.

---

### 3. "Where Am I?"

**The Problem:**
- Hard to know location
- Need landmarks to orient
- "Am I at the door?"

**Our Solution:**
```
"Door directly ahead, 2.3 meters away."
"Traffic light on your left, 4.5 meters away."
"Stairs directly ahead, 1.2 meters away."
```

**Why It Matters:**
You know where you are relative to landmarks.

---

### 4. "Is Something Moving Toward Me?"

**The Problem:**
- Cars, bikes, people can appear
- No warning of approaching objects
- Dangerous situations

**Our Solution:**
```
"Warning: Person approaching on your left, 1.5 meters."
"Bicycle moving on your right, 3.0 meters."
"Car approaching directly ahead."
```

**Why It Matters:**
You know when something is coming toward you.

---

### 5. "Which Way Should I Turn?"

**The Problem:**
- Path blocked, what now?
- Multiple obstacles
- Need clear direction

**Our Solution:**
```
"Path blocked ahead. Stop and listen for guidance."
"Path clear to your left." (specific direction)
"Safe path left or right, not straight." (options)
```

**Why It Matters:**
Clear, actionable directions - not just "obstacle detected."

---

## How It's Different

### Old Way (What Doesn't Help):
```
"Object detected."
"Obstacle ahead."
"Person 2.3 meters."
```

**Problem:** Not helpful! Where? What do I do?

### OrbyGlasses Way:
```
"STOP! Chair directly ahead, 0.9 meters. Do not move forward."
"Path clear straight ahead. Bench on your left at 2.0 meters."
"Warning: Person approaching on your right, 1.5 meters."
```

**Better Because:**
- ✓ Tells you WHERE (left, right, ahead)
- ✓ Tells you WHAT to do (stop, turn left, keep going)
- ✓ Tells you WHY (approaching, head height, blocking path)
- ✓ Gives you DISTANCE (so you know urgency)

## Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Walking Down Sidewalk

**You Hear:**
```
Frame 1: "Path clear straight ahead."
Frame 50: "Pole on your right, 2.5 meters."
Frame 100: "Path clear straight ahead. Pole on your right at 1.2 meters."
Frame 120: "Person approaching on your left, 2.0 meters."
Frame 150: "Path clear to your right." (person passed)
```

**What This Means:**
- You can walk straight
- Pole is noted but not blocking
- Person approaching - be aware
- After person passes, continue

### Scenario 2: Approaching Door

**You Hear:**
```
Frame 1: "Door directly ahead, 5.0 meters away."
Frame 50: "Door directly ahead, 3.2 meters away."
Frame 100: "Door directly ahead, 1.5 meters away."
Frame 120: "STOP! Door directly ahead, 0.8 meters. Do not move forward."
```

**What This Means:**
- You know you're approaching door
- You get distance updates
- Stop warning before you hit it
- You can now feel for the door handle

### Scenario 3: Crossing Street

**You Hear:**
```
Frame 1: "Traffic light directly ahead, 3.0 meters away."
Frame 50: "Path clear straight ahead."
Frame 100: "Car approaching on your right, 5.0 meters."
Frame 120: "Warning: Car approaching on your right, 2.0 meters."
Frame 150: "STOP! Car on your right, 1.0 meters. Do not move forward."
```

**What This Means:**
- You found the crosswalk (traffic light)
- Car is coming - tracked across frames
- You get progressive warnings
- STOP before stepping into street

### Scenario 4: Finding Seat

**You Hear:**
```
Frame 1: "Bench on your left, 4.0 meters away."
Frame 50: "Bench on your left, 2.0 meters away."
Frame 80: "Path clear to your left. Bench on your left at 1.0 meters."
```

**What This Means:**
- You know where bench is
- You get direction to turn (left)
- You know when you're close enough
